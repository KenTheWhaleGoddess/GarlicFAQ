To setup,
1. Download the entire repo, unzip, and use your favorite code editor. Make sure it has support for Maven.
2. Go to the pom.xml file in your code editor, and build it via Maven. This will download all the neccessary files for the project.
3. After that, everything should be resolved. For now, make sure any tokens are not in your commit files.

Feel free to make any submissions you feel would help.
