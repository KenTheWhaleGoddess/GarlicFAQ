FAQ bot for the Garlicoin discord server

To setup,
1. Download and unzip, or create new files of identical name and copy paste them in.
2. Use an code editor which supports Java Maven. This is required to install all the dependencies.

To run, you can either build the project as a jar, and run, or you can run inside your code editor.

If you see no static logger errors, you can ignore those.
Errors related to a failed login is probably because you did not put a token for the bot to run on. You can change the token the bot runs on by editing the .env file.
